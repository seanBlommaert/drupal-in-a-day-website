# Drupal in a Day

This project contains the Drupal in a Day website.
It was based on [Composer template for Drupal projects](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).
Also read the documentation of the template for more information.

## Install

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar)
for your setup.

After that you can install the project from the root of the application:

```
composer install
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new modules to the
application.

```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:8.*
```

When adding new modules, make sure a specific version is specified. We don't want composer to download a different version unintentionally when building/updating the site.

__Install clean new site__

The [Config Installer](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_installer) module was added to be able to install a clean site from configuration.
More information on the module can be found in [this blog](https://evolvingweb.ca/blog/restoring-drupal-8-site-configuration-files).
Using drush you can easily set up a fresh installation for test/development:
- Make sure all composer packages are installed.
- Copy _web/sites/default/default.settings.local.php_ to _web/sites/default/settings.local.php_.
- Add database credentials and other custom config in your _settings.local.php_.
- Make sure that ```$config['config_split.config_split.development']['status'] = TRUE;``` is in settings.local.php
- Run the drush site install from the _web_ directory:
```drush si config_installer --account-name=[username-user-1] --account-pass=[your-password]```



## Module / core updates

- Change modules/core version numbers in _composer.json_
- Update code:
```composer update -n```
- Run DB updates:
```drush updb```
- Export config:
```drush cex```
- Commit changes:
```git commit -m 'Describe your awesome changes here.'```
- Push changes:
```git push```



## Configuration

The config split module is used to optimize the configuration import and export.
We want to keep development configuration out of the production environment (Field UI / Devel etc)
and add special handling for some configuration (Webform / Group menu's).

Read [this awesome article](https://blog.liip.ch/archive/2017/04/07/advanced-drupal-8-cmi-workflows.html) for more info on the workflow.

__Workflow__
- Export config:
```drush cex```
- Commit changes:
```git commit -m 'Describe your awesome changes here.'```
- Merge changes:
```git pull --rebase```
- Update dependencies:
```composer install```
- Run DB updates:
```drush updb```
- Import configuration:
```drush cim```
- Push changes:
```git push```

__Production__

Make sure the excluded config is not removed on the production environment with the following workflow:

- Export excluded config:
```drush -y config-split-export excluded```
- Import configuration:
```drush cim```



## Patches

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra
